# Automated Essay Scoring
> A Deep Learning/neural network model that predicts the score of a given input essay. 

//Dataset is from Kaggle ASAP competition which was provided by The Hewlett Foundation.

The **mysite** folder contains the Django app.

Look in here for GloVe files and embedding.pickle.
